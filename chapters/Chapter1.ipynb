    "To accept standard input use the built-in function **input()**. By default, standard input originates from a person typing at a keyboard. This will allow you to prompt the user directly for their input. In more complex cases standard input can come from other sources. For example, you are able to send the output from one command as the standard input to another command just by using pipes.
