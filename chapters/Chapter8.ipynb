    "from the keyboard. You’ve also learned how to send data to standard output—the screen—using the\n",
    "**print()** function. While understanding and utilizing standard input and output will work well for certain\n",
    "types of applications, you will often need a place to store the data generated by your program. Also,\n",
    "you will need a way to retrieve saved data as well. One of the most common places to store data is\n",
    "within a file. You can read input and write output to a file, just like you can read input from a keyboard\n",
    "and display output on a screen.\n",
    "\n",
    "To open a file, use the built-in **open()** function. The pattern for this is **open(path_to_file)**. The **path_to_file** can be either an absolute or a relative path, and it includes the file name. An absolute path will contain the entire path beginning at the root of the file system, be that a <b>/</b> in Mac or Linux, or a drive letter in Windows. Examples of absolute paths are **/var/log/messages** and\n",
    "**C:\\Log\\Messages\\data.txt**. A relative path however, will comprise just the file name or a portion of\n",
    "the path which starts at the current working directory. An example of a relative path is **log/messages**.\n",

    "backslashes as the directory separator. For instance, **C:/Users/david/Documents/pythonnotes.txt** is a valid absolute path within Python. Also, **Documents/python-notes.txt** is a validrelative path.\n",
