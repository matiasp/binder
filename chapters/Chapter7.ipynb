    "A tuple is an immutable list, meaning that once it is defined it cannot be changed. This is different from\n",
    "normal lists in which you can add, remove, and change the values. With tuples none of these actions are an option. Where tuples are similar to lists is that they are ordered in the same fashion, and the values in the tuple can be still be accessed by index. In fact, you can perform many of the same operations on a tuple that you can on a list. You can concatenate tuples, you can iterate over the values in a tuple with a **for** loop, you can access values from the end of the tuple using negative indices, and you can access slices of a tuple. Tuples are created using comma separated values between parentheses. The pattern is **tuple_name = (item_1, item_2, item_N)**. If you only want a single item in a tuple, that single item must always be followed by a comma. The pattern is **tuple_name = (item_1,)**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Tuples are key for organizing and holding data that will not, or should not change at any point during the execution of your program. Using a tuple is a great way to ensure that the values are not accidentally altered. For example, the months of the year should not change."
